# Changelog

All notable changes to **Soup CLI** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Detailed, per-release notes for every published version live on the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/releases). This
file tracks unreleased changes and links out for historical detail rather than
reproducing 70+ versions of notes.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.71.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Breaking — install split.** The heavy training stack (`torch`,
  `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`) moved
  out of the core install into a new `[train]` extra. `pip install soup-cli` is
  now a light CLI + data-tools install with **no PyTorch**; run
  `pip install 'soup-cli[train]'` (or `[all]`) to fine-tune. Existing users who
  train must reinstall with `[train]`. Version pins are unchanged.
- Trimmed `README.md` to a ~238-line front door; the full feature reference now
  lives under `docs/` (one topic page per area, indexed from the README).
- Raised the pytest coverage gate from 50% to 77% (`--cov-fail-under=77`).
- Migrated to a `src/` layout (`src/soup_cli/`) for cleaner packaging and to
  stop tests accidentally importing the in-tree package.

### Added
- `[train]` and `[all]` optional-dependency extras (`[all]` pulls
  `train`, `serve`, `ui`, `data`). `[dev]` self-references `[train]` so CI and
  contributors still get the full stack from `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- Friendly error mapping: a missing heavy dependency (`torch`, `transformers`,
  `peft`, `trl`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`) now surfaces
  "Training needs the [train] extra. Run: pip install 'soup-cli[train]'".
- `py.typed` marker (PEP 561) so downstream type checkers pick up Soup's inline
  type hints.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with ruff (lint + format) and standard file-hygiene
  hooks.
- Lenient `mypy` configuration and a non-blocking `type-check` CI job.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Removed
- The historical, per-version security-fix log that had grown inside
  `SECURITY.md` (~220 KB). `SECURITY.md` is now a concise security policy; the
  detailed hardening notes remain in git history and the GitHub Releases notes.
